  <h1>What Is Formula SAE</h1>
  <p>
    <strong
      >Formula SAE (FSAE) is a student design competition endorsed by the Society of Automotive
      Engineers. Each year SAE International challenges students to design, build, and race a small
      open wheel car. During the design phase, students must adhere to competition rules created by
      SAE International. These rules encourage students to create more innovative designs and test
      their engineering skills with real world problems. The Formula SAE competition is designed to
      test each team’s knowledge of various aspects of vehicle design and manufacturing. Each year,
      student built cars are presented to members of industry who judge their engineering decisions
      and designs. These critiques help teams learn about and improve upon designs. The cars are
      also rigorously tested during dynamic events which evaluate drivability, reliability, and the
      overall performance of the car. Both static and dynamic events are used to determine a winner.

  <h1>Purdue Formula SAE</h1>
  <p>
    <strong
      >Purdue University is recognized world-wide for its excellent engineering program. Members of
      the Purdue Formula SAE team create a well-designed car each year by combining the theory
      learned in class with hands-on skills. Students utilize engineering skills and state of the
      art tools to manufacture and validate the new car. Our team is comprised primarily of
      mechanical engineering students, but we also welcome students from other majors. Purdue FSAE
      is first and foremost a team. Our team spends an enormous amount of time together throughout
      the school year which helps us work together effectively. We collaborate to find new ways to
      combine our wide array of engineering talents and experiences to build and design a unique
      race car.</strong
